# dig-make
This is a top down sandbox game called `Dig Make`. It is my final project for my junior year at Prosser. The game still remains unfinished, given the small time frame and the ambition from the project. I hope to return to the project and keep adding to it.

The modules required can be downloaded using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`, given that you have python installed and are running the command in the requirements directory.
